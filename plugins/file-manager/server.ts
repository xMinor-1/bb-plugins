/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Integration note (BACKEND-CORE → BACKEND-TRANSFER)
 *
 * The four imports above are the *entire* coupling surface between the two
 * backend workstreams. src/rpc.ts deliberately imports none of them: it takes
 * the seven transfer methods as `deps.transfer`, typed straight off
 * contract.ts, so a name change here is a one-line edit in this file only.
 *
 * Expected exports:
 *   src/jobs.ts        createJobs(bb) -> { jobStatus, jobCancel }
 *                      (handlers matching the contract methods of the same name)
 *   src/archives.ts    createArchives(bb, { jobs, settings })
 *                        -> { extractArchive, support: { zip, tar, sevenZip } }
 *   src/uploads.ts     createUploads(bb, { settings })
 *                        -> { uploadCreate, uploadStatus, uploadFinish,
 *                             uploadAbort, sweep() }
 *   src/http-routes.ts registerHttpRoutes(bb, { uploads }) -> void
 *
 * All three factories are awaited, so returning a plain object is fine too.
 * `settings` is the SettingsModule from src/settings.ts (chunkSizeBytes(),
 * preferences(), values(), resolveStartFolder(), savePreferences()).
