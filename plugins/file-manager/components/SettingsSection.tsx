// components/SettingsSection.tsx — the `app.slots.settingsSection` body on the
// plugin's detail page in Tools.
//
// It exists because bb's declarative settings form can only render the four
// descriptor types (string / select / boolean / project) and none of them is a
// path picker: `startFolder` therefore shows up above this section as a bare
// text field. This section is the same setting with a folder browser attached —
// it writes through the very same `savePreferences` method the panel uses
// (lib/start-folder.ts), so the CLI, the panel action and this form can never
// disagree.
//
// The host draws the heading and the one-line description from the registration
// in app.tsx (apps/app/src/components/plugin/PluginSettingsSections.tsx), so
// this component starts straight at the value — no heading of its own.
//
// Slot props are deliberately empty in V1, and the host mounts this outside the
// panel's subtree, so everything it renders comes from `getState`.
